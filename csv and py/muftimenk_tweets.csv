muftimenk,2018-12-01T00:29:58.000Z,"At times, we condemn good people because we disagree with them over a few issues. We refuse to see the good they’re doing. Disagreements do not automatically make a person extreme, bad or evil. Learn to distinguish between the one who respectfully disagrees & the one who is evil!",,,Islam
muftimenk,2022-11-03T12:14:05.000Z,"Shocked and  saddened by news that Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan was injured following a shooting incident. I wish him well and a speedy recovery. Violence in all forms is totally wrong and unacceptable, no matter what our differences may be. #imrankhaninjured",,,Islam
muftimenk,2021-05-14T00:59:27.000Z,"Almighty. It’s been a difficult period for all. Even as we celebrate #Eid our hearts are breaking seeing the oppression going on. But in all this we lay our complete trust in You. Protect those most at risk, the elderly, women & children. Comfort those who have lost loved ones.",,,Islam
muftimenk,2021-02-03T09:35:16.000Z,Life is too short. Live it with passion and purpose. Don’t let anger control you. Don’t let hate breed in your heart. Don’t let negativity be the order of your day. Keep your heart guided in the right direction. Seek the Almighty’s help constantly to purify your heart!,,,Islam
muftimenk,2022-10-19T03:33:35.000Z,Don’t make the mistake of telling someone too much about yourself. Oversharing is bad. It can invite negative energy and vibes from those who don’t want good for you. Share only with those who have proven they truly care.,,,Islam
muftimenk,2021-08-16T22:38:18.000Z,"Whatever you do, don’t hurt others. When you try to hurt those who hurt you, you’re only hurting yourself. Because it’s not in your character to act in an ugly manner. What you need to do is forgive and move on. Easier said than done for most. But only good can overcome evil.",,,Islam
muftimenk,2021-12-27T04:26:55.000Z,Do yourself a favour. Protect your mind from overthinking. It’s a disability which serves no purpose. You need to protect your own thoughts. There’s nothing in this world that can trouble you more than your own thoughts.,,,Islam
muftimenk,2021-03-09T21:15:39.000Z,Be careful how you treat people. The tables always turn. The Almighty will see to it. Be careful who you ignore when you’re at the top. Some choose to treat people any which way that pleases them. Don’t! It will come back to you. You’ll be made to eat humble pie sooner or later!,,,Islam
muftimenk,2020-10-19T19:16:20.000Z,"Stop comparing. Start cherishing what you have before it’s taken away from you. Gratitude is key. Be hopeful about what’s coming. Always believe that the Almighty wants good for us. He has blessed us with so much, more than we’ve asked for. Move forward with prayer & firm faith!",,,Islam
muftimenk,2024-05-28T07:51:23.000Z,"The worst genocide of our lifetime is happening right now. By massacring tens of thousands, injuring hundreds of thousands and beheading babies, what are you trying to achieve? Calling it a tragic mishap is pathetic! If anything, it's a sign that you've lost. Lost your humanity.",,,Islam
muftimenk,2023-03-22T16:40:49.000Z,I wish every one the most blessed and spiritually uplifting  #Ramadan . May the Almighty keep us steadfast and grant us the best month. Aameen,,,Islam
