The Credit Information Bureau (CIB) of the BB issued a circular on Thursday, asking the banks to submit monthly information of each loan to the credit information system (CIS) within the first 15 days of each month.
Seeking anonymity, a BB official said that with such submissions, the bureau will be able to do proper analysis of every loan like the repayment behavior of the borrowers.
""It will also help monitor each loan more rigorously. That's why it is important,"" the official said.
If the status of the loan changes like renewal, restructuring and rescheduling between two monthly submissions, the banks will upload those in the CIS counting the month of changes, said the central banker.

Approximately 50,000 individuals have submitted their income tax returns online using the e-Return option (www.etaxnbr.gov) until now, according to a press release issued by the National Board of Revenue (NBR) on Thursday.
Additionally, a call centre (09643717171) that the NBR launched on September 12 has been assisting the taxpayers by promptly answering their inquiries related to the submission of tax returns.
The taxpayers can also raise issues related to the online return systems through the eTaxService option available at www.etaxnbr.gov.bd.
Recently, the NBR has upgraded the e-return registration option to make it more user-friendly.
The taxpayers can now register in the e-Return portal using their biometric SIM, which they obtained through their National Identity (NID) card. They can verify whether their mobile number is biometric registered by dialling #16001#.
Furthermore, taxpayers can pay their taxes via the portal using internet banking, debit or credit cards, and mobile banking.

The core inflation rose to 10.57 per cent in August on a point-to-point basis from 8.66 per cent a month before, according to the central bank's latest statistics. It was 9.52 per cent in December 2022.
Currently, the Bangladesh Bank (BB) is measuring the core inflation by excluding food and fuel components from the consumer price index (CPI).
The central bank had taken a strong measure by announcing a plan for increasing the policy rate twice by October 2024 after calculating the latest core- inflation figures in its bid to cool the mercury.
Earlier on September 23 this calendar year, new BB governor Dr Ahsan H. Mansur disclosed the central bank's current inflation-combat plan at a press briefing at the BB headquarters in Dhaka.
As per announcement, the central bank raised the policy rate, also known as the repo rate, by 50 basis points to 9.50 per cent on September 25 in an effort to combat the inexorable inflation.
A policy-rate hike means banks under liquidity crunch will now have to pay more interest on loans taken from the central bank.
To manage liquidity more effectively, the BB also raised the upper limit of the policy- interest corridor. The Standing Lending Facility (SLF) rate rises to 11 per cent, up from 10.5 per cent, while the Standing Deposit Facility (SDF) floor rate moves up to 8.0 per cent from 7.5 per cent.
Talking to the FE, Mustafa K Mujeri, executive director of the Institute for Inclusive Finance and Development (InM), suggested the central bank continue its anti-inflationary drives until the inflation came under control.
""We need to further strengthen our measures to curb the inflationary pressure on the economy,"" the senior economist notes.
Mr Mujeri, also a former chief economist of the central bank, thinks it will take more time to contain inflation.
""Core inflation has a stronger relationship with the Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) than that of CPI,"" a BB senior official told the FE on Saturday while explaining the importance of the core inflation.
He also said higher costs of non-food items, particularly medicines, clothing and transportation, pushed up core inflation during the period under review.
The prime objective of computing core inflation is to separate out the components of headline inflation, officially known as general inflation, that are caused by non-monetary events as these price changes do not reflect the impact of underlying monetary-policy decisions.
""Higher depreciation of the Bangladesh Taka (BDT) against the US dollar has also contributed to rise in core inflation in Bangladesh,"" another central banker explains.
The BDT depreciated by Tk 10 to Tk 120 from Tk 110 each US dollar from May to August this year, he notes.
The central banker, however, hopes the situation is improving gradually as the pressure on the country's foreign-exchange market is easing because of higher inflow of remittances and lower import- payment obligations.
""We expect that the core inflation along with the CPI will ease further in the coming months as the central bank is working on the issue seriously,"" the central banker says.
Bangladesh's inflation as measured by consumer price index eased further to 9.92 per cent in the month of September on the point-to-point basis mainly due to lower prices of both food and non-food items.
The inflation dropped 58 basis points to 9.92 per cent in September this calendar year from 10.49 per cent a month before. It was 9.72 per cent in June 2024, according to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS)'s latest data.

The NGO representatives sought the recognition at a meeting with the white paper committee at NEC Conference Room in the city’s Sher-e-Bangla Nagar area, BSS reports. 
Representatives from local and international development organizations participated in the meeting. “They (NGOs representatives) think the issue of recognition of the non-government development organizations to development needs to be considered with importance,” said Dr Bhattacharya at a press briefing after the meeting.
Raising the views of the NGO representatives, he said although the non-government development organizations have a big role in the government’s various previous and present initiatives, but they have no proper representation locally or nationally in the initiatives.
Since the condition of the people is now getting more miserable due to high inflation and other reasons, they think that the government support and its policy coordination are required to strengthen the role of non-government development partners to address the problems, he added.
Dr Debapriya, also a distinguished fellow at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD), said NGOs want removal of institutional barriers, corruption for their activities as they are of the view that various institutional barriers and corruption in the government’s concerned institutions are among the biggest obstacles, which stand in the way to properly run the activities of the non-government development organizations.
The institutional barriers are intentional in many cases and the government policies and regulations become barriers in some cases, he added.
At that time, they also mentioned the specific names of the concerned institutions that oversee the non-governmental organizations, district administration and law enforcement agencies are among these organizations, he said.
The NGO leaders suggested ensuring proper government management and freeing the institutions from corruption, said the white paper committee chief, adding that the participants also questioned the role of Bangladeshi missions abroad.
Answering a question, Dr Debapriya said the meeting discussed that corruption takes place when a non-government development organization goes to get registration, renews its registration certificate and gets its projects approved by the institutions concerned.
More than one restrictive measure has been imposed recently against the non-government development organisations to limit their activities and role to raise voice in favour of the people, said Dr Debapriya, also the convener of the Citizen's Platform for SDGs. 
The meeting also discussed corruption in the digital disbursement of micro-credits as well as health, education and other allowances, he said.
Earlier in August, the interim government formed a 12-member committee, led by Dr Debapriya Bhattacharya, to prepare a comprehensive ‘white paper’ on the state of Bangladesh's economy.","","",""

The expenditure of upgrading the four-lane Hatikamrul-Rangpur highway from Tangail’s Elenga has also been raised by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council, or ECNEC, at its meeting on Monday.
The spending of the deep-sea port project was initially estimated at Tk 177 billion during the Awami League government, along with its term until Dec 31, 2026
In the first amendment, the cost of the project was slightly increased to Tk 178 billion.
The expense of the revised project in the second phase stood at Tk 243.81 billion, reports bdnews24.com.
Without explaining the reason for the increase in expenditure by more than a third, Planning Advisor Wahiduddin Mahmud said the cause for the increase is ‘technical and he is not fully ‘aware’ of it.""
The Japan International Cooperation Agency, or JICA, would provide the additional amount to the interim administration as a loan, he said.
The period of the country's first and only deep-sea port project has also been extended by three years until December 2029.
A total of four projects were approved at the second ECNEC meeting of the interim government. The cost of two revised projects among them has been increased. The rest of the two projects are new.
At a briefing after the meeting, the planning advisor said it could be the only ‘major infrastructure project’ of the transitional government.
""Since a jetty has been built in Matarbari, we have considered the project of building a deep-sea port there. It's a big project with a lot of geopolitical significance and who is implementing it is also a big issue.""
Highlighting the importance of the project, Mahmud said: ""We all know that we need a deep-sea port. Chattogram and Payra ports do not have that capacity. When Bangladesh's trade will expand further, the spending will be much higher if we don't have a deep-sea port.
“We dared to approve this because there was a lot of tension about whether China would implement it or India, but nothing was finalised for a long time.""
""Japan gives loans on very easy terms. The Japanese projects are probably the only projects that... [to some extent, South Korea also] completed on time at the right cost. Such as metro rail's MRT Line-5 and third terminal at Dhaka airport.""
COST OF SECOND PROJECT ALSO RISES
A total of four projects – two revised and two new – were presented at the meeting.
The second revised project is the four-lane upgradation of the Elenga-Hatikamrul-Rangpur highway under the South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation, or SASEC, Road Link Project-2.
The cost of the project has been increased to Tk 3.76 billion.
ECNEC has also increased the spending on the four-lane highway project from Tangail’s Elenga to Rangpur on the northern route by about Tk 3.67 billion.
The Awami League government had initiated the project at Tk 118.99 billion. Later, the expenditure was increased to Tk 186.79 billion in two phases.
After a raise by the interim government, the new expenditure will stand at Tk 190.65 billion.
Stating that the duration of seven more projects has also been extended without increasing the cost, the advisor said: “The current projects are being revised. That is taking time.
""Private sector investment is low, if projects get slow, the flow of money will not increase. To raise it, the work of the previous project must be moved forward and some new projects should be in.""

Islamic banks, which once remained in a strong position in the country, have now landed in a worse situation due to such vicious acts, former Managing Director (MD) of Islami Bank Bangladesh PLC Mohammad Abdul Mannan observed on Tuesday.
""Such mischief, such a ruthless culture of malpractice to destroy the country's Islamic banking sector has never taken place in world history,"" he told a workshop.

He was addressing as a panellist of a research workshop on 'Pricing of Islamic Banking Products in a Dual Banking Environment of Bangladesh', organised by the Bangladesh Institute of Bank Management (BIBM) at its conference centre in the city on Tuesday.
Comparing the wilful attack on Buddhist civilization in the subcontinent, Mr Mannan said the country's Islamic banking had been similarly attacked in the last several years.
The top banker, who is now Chairman of Board of Directors of the First Security Islami Bank, had been forced to resign from the MD position of the then IBBL at gunpoint in 2017 before S Alam Group took over the control of the bank, the largest Shariah-based bank in the country.
Before January 2017, the excess liquidity of the IBBL was over Tk 250 billion, he said, indicating the bank's then strong position.
Highlighting on the inner strength of Islamic Banking, he said that it is high time the sector turned around for which events like research workshops could help a great deal.
Bangladesh Bank (BB) Deputy Governor and Chairman of BIBM Executive Committee Nurun Nahar inaugurated the workshop as chief guest, joining virtually.
BIBM Director General Dr Md Akhtaruzzaman chaired the programme while Managing Director & CEO of Shahjalal Islami Bank Mosleh Uddin Ahmed, and Shariah-based banking expert Dr Md Anwar Hosain Molla were present as panellists.
Addressing the participants, Ms Nahar expressed hope that the Islamic banking sector would turn around soon from the current sorry state.
Referring to the success of such a banking sector, she said that yet many developed countries have been following the model of Islamic banks in Bangladesh.
Highlighting on challenges, Mr Anwar Hosain Molla said Islamic banking officials have to work in an internal dual environment inside a conventional bank, in addition to the dual market situation.
'Niat' or intention is important for introducing IB, he said, adding: ""However, some banks have introduced Islamic banking only to attract or retain customers.""
Although 30 per cent of the banking sector is Shariah-based, the central bank's circulars are solely focused on conventional banking, he said and called for separate circulars on the same issue.
Mr Mosleh Uddin Ahmed said unless every rule and guidelines are prepared by the regulator, Islamic banking cannot flourish in full swing. Even after 42 years of IB activities in the country, a full-fledged shariah banking guideline has not been prepared, he added.
Currently, many common people believe that the IB is a fraud, he said, suggesting an external Shariah-based organisation to audit a bank to ensure Shariah there.
BIBM Associate Professor Dr. Md. Mahabbat Hossain presented a draft research report which was co-authored by BIBM Associate Professor Md. Alamgir, Bangladesh Bank Director (Statistics) Dr. Muhammad Amir Hossain and a researcher at INCEIF University of Malaysia Mezbah Uddin Ahmed.
According to the draft research, the dual obligation of Islamic banks and financial institutions to Shariah and regulatory authorities introduce complexity into their pricing models and operational strategies.
The report is expected to be finalised incorporating suggestions and other inputs from the participants.

""We could keep inflation rate at steady level to some extent. Taming inflation will take time. Some sort of relief will come,"" he told reporters.
The adviser was briefing newsmen after a meeting of the Advisory Council Committee on Government Purchase at Bangladesh secretariat in the capital.
He mentioned some measures taken by the current interim government to bring down commodity prices. ""We have lessened duty on onion and potato. Today we lowered import duty on sugar.""
Mr Ahmed, also adviser for the ministry of commerce, said there would be no scarcity of essential commodities on the market.
""Today approval has been given to buy lentils, liquefied natural gas, and fertiliser. You will get relief,"" he assured.
Replying to a query as to how much time needed to tame the wayward inflation, the adviser urged all not to get impatient. ""This is a very complex issue. Don't assume that inflation rose all of a sudden. Many factors are behind this.""
He enumerates the factors: ""There is market factor, market-monitoring factor, production, and marketing factor. New people have replaced the old ones, in some cases, with such nature remaining almost the same,"" Mr Ahmed said.
Replying to another question, the adviser said extortion got reduced but there are also matters relating to the law-and-order situation.
According to official data released by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), the point-to-point inflation declined to 9.92 per cent in September from 10.49 per cent in August last.
Commodity prices have shot up in the recent weeks, especially after floods in different parts of the country destroyed their production, mounting the misery of poor and middle-income group of people.
The prices of kitchen items have gone beyond the purchasing capacity of common people due to production fall and supply shortage amid floods. Egg prices also shot up significantly with each dozen selling at around Tk 180 in the market.
Meantime, the purchase-committee meeting approved a proposal to import one-cargo LNG from M/S Gunvor Singapore Pte Ltd, Singapore, at a cost of Tk 6.57 billion. Each unit of the liquefied natural gas will cost $13.93.
The meeting also approved for the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC) to buy 30,000 tonnes of TSP fertiliser from OCP, SA, Morocco, at a cost of Tk 1.49 billion with each tonne of fertiliser costing $415.
Under another approval, Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC) will import 30,000 tonnes of bulk granular urea fertiliser from SABIC Agri Nutrients Company, Saudi Arabia, for Tk 1.28 billion where each tonne will cost $356.17.
Also, BCIC is given the go-ahead to buy 30,000 tonnes of bagged granular urea fertiliser from KAFCO, Bangladesh at a cost of Tk 1.23 billion with each tonne of fertiliser costing $343.37.
Moreover, the committee gave approval for the buy of 10,000 tonnes of lentils for the Trading Corporation of Bangladesh from a Chattogram-based supplier at a total cost of Tk 963 million, each kilogram costing Tk 96.39.

When it comes to wage earners' remittance and assets, unconventional banks have kept losing their share in recent months as it has become a matter of concern, particularly to a section of Islamic bankers.
According to Islamic banking-related statistics of the Bangladesh Bank (BB), the country's central bank, the entire volume of deposits in Islamic banking operations dropped by Tk 30.14 billion to stand at Tk 4.73 trillion until July from the June count of Tk 4.40 trillion.
But the total Islamic banking investment volume reached a record high in July, amounting to Tk 5.15 trillion, up by Tk 11.01 billion from Tk 5.13 trillion in the previous month of June, disclosed the data.
The continuous fall of share was also observed in remittance earnings, considered one of the main strengths of such banking operations.
Islamic banking bagged more than 51.57 per cent of the country's overall remittance earnings even in December 2023.
Since then, shariah-based banking operations have kept losing their share with the fall of their remittance share to 41.46 per in February and 39.96 per cent in March.
Now, the share of the banks dropped further to 34.97 per cent in July 2024, according to the BB data.
The assets holding of the Islamic banks in the industry also plummeted to 18.95 per cent in July from 19.32 per cent recorded in its previous month.
Seeking anonymity, a BB official said there were a number of media reports regarding large-scale loan-related irregularities in these unconventional banks, which might shatter people's confidence.
""These could be a reason behind such a fall in market share,"" the central banker said.
An Islamic bank's managing director, who preferred not to be quoted by name, said savers started diverting their funds into conventional banks despite their multiple steps to convince them.
As a matter of fact, the growth of deposits in such banks has slowed down in recent times, which is probably reflected in the data.
The contribution of the shariah-based banks in terms of receiving remittance was huge even a few months ago, but it has dropped remarkably in recent times, he said.
""And it is a matter of serious concern for us. But we're trying our best to improve the situation,"" added the banker.
Deputy managing director (DMD) and chief financial officer (CFO) of Al-Arafah Islamic Bank Muhammod Nadim said the country witnessed a build-up to the uprising in July that severely disrupted banking operations across the country.
""This could be a major reason behind the fall in the deposit collection by the Islamic banks in July. But our bank managed to maintain deposit growth in that month,"" he said.
Regarding a fall in remittance, Mr Nadim said exchange houses have been selling dollars through bidding in recent months. Under the mechanism, those who bid higher rates get the greenback.
""This is one of the reasons behind the remittance drop,"" he added.

The company, capable of producing over 27.5 million yards of garments annually, also intended to invest in an associated garment factory to boost its turnover by Tk 4.0 billion and create employment for 2,000 people.
However, rising interest rates have hampered the plans of the fully export-orientated and publicly listed company.
Shams Mahmud, managing director of Shasha Denims Ltd, said: ""We had decided to invest Tk 6 billion in these new factories and expand the business, but now we’ve stepped back. It’s not viable to do business by borrowing and paying such high interest rates.""
Shams told bdnews24.com that the company has scaled down its investment to Tk 1.6 billion, focussing only on essential investments.
“This is the amount that we cannot avoid. We are only making that investment,” he added.





Shasha Denims, one of the major players in the garment sector, currently employs 1,600 workers across its three dyeing units. The company, which won the national export trophy last year, reported an annual revenue of Tk 7.88 billion in the 2022–23 fiscal year.
Shasha Denims is not the only company affected by these high interest rates. Entrepreneurs across industries, from large corporations to small businesses, are facing similar challenges.
The liquidity crunch in the banking sector and rising interest rates are creating significant barriers to business expansion, increasing production costs and hindering job creation.





As a result, low-income earners, who are struggling to cope with inflation, are finding it increasingly difficult to find work or secure wage increases.
Inflation has been hovering in the double digits or close to it for nearly two years, largely due to the economic stagnation brought on by the global Covid-19 pandemic. The situation worsened when the Russia-Ukraine war destabilised oil markets, and the rising exchange rate of the US dollar further exacerbated the crisis.
The country’s economy was already in turmoil when export orders from the West began to decline, and inflation spiralled out of control, causing immense hardship to regular people.
Despite recommendations from economic analysts to let market forces dictate interest rates and raise the policy rate, the '9-6' interest cap remained in place.
However, the cap was lifted in 2023 under pressure from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) allowing interest rates to be determined by the market.
As the central bank raised the repo rate to control inflation, the cost of loans soared, making business operations even more challenging. Import costs surged as well, further straining businesses.
After the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government and the interim government’s assumption of power, the central bank raised the policy interest rate twice, pushing the loan interest rate from 9.0 per cent to 14 per cent in just one year.
This rapid rise in interest rates has alarmed business leaders, who are concerned that inflation, which remains high at 9.92 per cent, is still not under control despite the rate hikes.
DECREASE IN LCS, DECLINE IN PRIVATE LOANS
One key indicator of declining investment in the country is the decrease in the opening of letters of credit, or LCs, for imports.
According to Bangladesh Bank, LC openings for imports dropped by 13 per cent in the first two months of the current fiscal year 2024-25.
The central bank said LC openings stood at $10.03 billion in July and August, down from $11.51 billion in the same period last year, a 12.85 per cent decline.
Similarly, LC settlements in the first two months of the fiscal year amounted to $10.34 billion, compared to $11.89 billion in the same period last year, a 13.03 per cent decrease.
In June 2023, private sector credit growth stood at 9.84 per cent, down from 10.58 per cent in the same period last year. By the end of June 2023, the total credit disbursed to the private sector was Tk 16.41 trillion, compared to Tk 14.94 trillion in June of the previous fiscal year.
INTEREST RATE HIKE CALLED A 'DISASTROUS DECISION'
In July 2020, the average interest rate on bank loans was 7.79 per cent, but by July this year, it had risen to 11.57 per cent.
After the interim government took power, economist Ahsan H Mansur, who had long advocated for raising interest rates to control inflation, was appointed governor of Bangladesh Bank.
Following his appointment, Mansur raised the repo rate by 50 basis points to 9.0 per cent on Aug 25.
A month later, he raised it by another 50 basis points to 9.50 per cent.
The previous government had already raised the policy rate by 25 basis points in January and 50 basis points in May this year.
As a result of these four consecutive hikes, loan interest rates at the customer level reached 14 per cent.
Shams said, ""Raising interest rates to control inflation is a contractionary measure in the context of Bangladesh. While it can function as one method of curbing inflation, it is a disastrous policy for investments.""
Shams pointed out the various obstacles facing the country’s exports in the global market, saying: “The prices of goods have increased instead. It’s impossible to keep a business viable with a working capital loan.”
“We might be able to get by temporarily by deferring payments. But after LDC [least developed country] graduation, where will we get the investment money to remain competitive in the European market?” he asked.
He also claimed that eco-friendly investment policies do not adequately address these issues.
TWO-DIGIT INTEREST RATES: BUSINESS LEADERS QUESTION FEASIBILITY
Business leaders expressed concerns at a seminar on Saturday about the rising interest rates on bank loans, fearing it will drive up business costs and reduce profitability.
Syed Nasim Manzur, president of the Leather Goods and Footwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association of Bangladesh, said: ""No country with double-digit interest rates sees its businesses profit. Currently, interest rates in Bangladesh stand at 14 per cent.""
He added that this situation would deter foreign direct investment, critical for enhancing product quality, image, and global value chain integration.
Mir Nasir Hossain, former president of the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, or FBCCI, echoed similar concerns, saying the actual interest rate exceeds 14 per cent.
He attributed the hike to the $4.7 billion IMF loan, which increased interest rates, impacting businesses negatively.
He told bdnews24.com, ""Interest rates rose from 9 percent to 14-15 per cent, and it might increase further. This rise follows a compounding effect.""
He raised the question, ""Which industry or business can adjust and survive under such conditions?""
SMES STRUGGLING WITH LIQUIDITY CRISIS
Entrepreneurs, particularly in the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector, are facing significant challenges due to a liquidity crisis in banks.
Mohammad Gazi Touhidur Rahman, a former banker turned entrepreneur, shared his experience, saying, ""Banks currently have no deposits. How can they give out loans?""
Touhidur, who runs a large factory in Narsingdi employing over 200 workers, revealed that his company is struggling to secure loans. Even when customers deposit money in banks, withdrawing it becomes an issue, he said.
Nishat Anjum, the chief executive officer, or CEO, of AurumBangladesh, a pioneering fashion startup known for introducing distinctive block print and cotton apparel, shared a similar perspective.
She said: ""Getting loans is becoming impossible, and interest rates have shot up to 14 per cent, making profit generation difficult.""
Both entrepreneurs highlighted the hidden conditions in loan agreements, where the repayment often surpasses the principal amount, putting additional strain on small businesses.
NOW BANKS SEEK CUSTOMERS
A deputy branch in charge of a private bank pointed out that the dynamic has shifted.
“Earlier, customers used to seek out banks for loans; now banks are hunting for customers,” he said.
He explained that due to higher interest rates, his branch’s loan portfolio has dropped by 80 per cent in the past year.
""One customer moved to another bank today just for a slightly better rate,"" he said.
The new classification of non-performing loans, or NPLs, from nine overdue instalments to six has also reduced bank revenues and increased the number of NPLs.
""Classified loans rose from 12.43 per cent to 25.25 per cent in just one quarter,"" he remarked, questioning how banks can afford to cut interest rates under such circumstances.
WHAT’S THE SOLUTION?
Shasha Denims MD Shams stressed the need for prompt action to restore macroeconomic stability, saying: ""Investment is dampened and job generation is at a standstill. If the situation is not resolved swiftly, the economy will lose stability.""
Former FBCCI president Nasir suggested that high interest rates should be addressed immediately, as they are leading to an increase in non-performing loans and making it difficult for businesses to repay.
However, Zahid Hossain, former lead economist of the World Bank’s Dhaka office, offered a different perspective, arguing that inflation can only be curbed by maintaining tight monetary policies, including higher interest rates.
GOVERNMENT’S POSITION
Bangladesh Bank spokeswoman and executive director Husne Ara Shikha told bdnews24.com, ""The central bank governor's directive is clear: interest rates will continue to rise until inflation comes down to single digits.""
According to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) despite the challenges posed by political unrest, floods, and power transitions, overall inflation dropped below double digits in July-August, with September’s point-to-point inflation rate standing at 9.92 per cent.

Regarding the current business environment, Shikha added: ""Loan costs will be higher temporarily, but once inflation stabilises, interest rates will drop back to 6-9 per cent.""","","",""

Local sales from export-oriented companies, apparels' CMT export (cut-make- trim) and samples transfer were also behind the mismatch.
EPB officials pinpointed the reasons at a press briefing with journalists at its office in the city's Karwan Bazar area on Wednesday.
The officials said that they would regularly hold such monthly briefing in the coming days to release export data aiming to ensure transparency in the process.
EPB CEO and Vice-chairman Md Anwar Hossain, its director Abu Mukhles Alamgir Hossain and another director Mohammed Shahjalal were present, among others.
Mr Anwar Hossain said they have prepared the updated data on the basis of real time shipment data as per NBR Asycuda world.
He also said they would continue to provide further elaborated data for the sake of stakeholders including traders home and abroad, investors, researchers, journalists and academia.
""We shall present them in facilitated formats on EPB website so that stakeholders can access easily,"" he said.
Software is also being developed to make customised reports and info-graphs, that will be available online soon, he added.
Mr Alamgir Hossain made a brief PowerPoint presentation on updated export data.
According to it, the country's export earnings from merchandise were nearly $44.47 billion in the last fiscal year (FY) 2023-24 which was wrongly calculated as $55.29.
In the previous FY 2022-23, the updated figure was $46.43 billion instead of $55 billion. Bangladesh's export earnings amounted to US$11.37 billion during the July-September period of the running fiscal year 2024-25.
Single-month export earnings in September 2024 grew by 6.78 per cent to US$3.51 billion, year on year, which was US$3.29 billion in the corresponding month of 2023.
The bureau has also set a target of $57.50 export earnings consisting $50 billion from merchandise and $7.5 from service export in the running FY 2024-25.
