Chief Advisor Muhammad Yunus has called on Singapore to support Bangladesh in recovering billions of dollars laundered overseas and to help lower migration costs from the country.
Singapore's Ambassador to Bangladesh Derek Loh met Yunus at his office in Dhaka’s Tejgaon on Sunday, where they discussed for about an hour, according to a statement from Chief Advisor’s Press Wing.
“A lot of money was siphoned off from Bangladesh to many countries, including Singapore,” the chief advisor said to Loh, adding, “We need full cooperation from Singapore.”
Ambassador Loh assured Yunus of Singapore’s support in this matter.
Yunus also urged the island nation to work with Dhaka to lower recruitment costs significantly, allowing Bangladeshi expatriates to remit more earnings to their families.
""We can create a model structure with Singapore on reducing recruitment costs,"" he said.
The envoy shared similar goals, expressing Singapore’s commitment to eradicating rent-seeking practices in the recruitment process.
He advised Bangladesh to digitalise its recruitment system to curb human trafficking and exploitation risks.
They also discussed trade and investment cooperation, the foreign policy of the interim government, shipping, education, and healthcare of their respective peoples, the statement read.
Yunus said Bangladesh was now ready for business with the economy making a good recovery just three months after the dictatorship left it in shambles.
""It is a good time to do business here,"" he added.
Senior director of Singapore Ministry of Trade and Industry Francis Chong said Bangladesh had proposed a Free Trade Agreement, or FTA, with Singapore back in 2021.
He added that the feasibility study for the FTA has concluded, and both nations are considering steps to initiate negotiations.
Loh said Singapore would be happy to share its expertise in water treatment and waste energy management.
The ambassador proposed collaboration between the food agencies of both countries.
Regarding foreign policy, Yunus emphasised Bangladesh’s commitment to maintaining good relations with neighbouring nations and reviving the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation, or SAARC, as a platform for deeper engagement with South Asia.
The advisor sought Singapore's backing for Bangladesh's inclusion as a sectoral dialogue partner of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, to which Loh said his country was open to the idea.
Yunus said Dhaka has got huge support from its Western and Eastern allies since the caretaker administration took over.
""We do not distinguish between east and west. We have to build bridges everywhere,” he added.",https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/f919252724f7,"10 Nov 2024, 07:28 PM",Bangladesh

A group of students have beaten up several people and handed them over to police for chanting slogans like ‘Joy Bangla’ and ‘Sheikh Hasina will return’ in front of the Awami League’s central office on Bangabandhu Avenue in the capital’s Gulistan.
Since Sunday morning, police have been interrogating any 'suspicious’ individuals in the area.

According to Shahriar, policemen are working in the field to bring the situation under control.

He also addressed a complaint filed against the interim government by an Awami League leader at the International Criminal Court, calling it a ‘baseless’ attempt to tarnish the administration's image.

International Crimes Tribunal Chief Prosecutor Mohammad Tajul Islam and Prosecutor Gazi Monawar Hossain Tamim were also present at the time.
Asked about the prosecution of the Awami League as a party, Tajul said: “Whenever the government tells us to start trying them as a party.

Body of missing child Muntaha recovered from canal near Sylhet home,https://cdn.bdnews24.com/bdnews24/media/bangla/imgAll/2024November/sylhet-muntaha-101124-01-1731219982.jpg,bdnews24,"
A child who had been missing for seven days has been found dead in a canal near her home in Sylhet's Kanaighat Upazila.
Police recovered the body around 3am on Sunday with a rope tied around her neck, said Abdul Awal, chief of Kanaighat Police Station.
The victim, six-year-old Muntaha Akter Jerin, was the daughter of Shamim Ahmed from Biradal village.
Shamim said that on Nov 3, Muntaha had returned home with him from a local religious event. Later, she went out to play with children from the neighbourhood .
When she didn’t return home by the afternoon, they began searching for her, but to no avail.
Shamim then filed a General Diary (GD) at Kanaighat Police Station.

The news of Muntaha’s disappearance spread rapidly on social media, prompting many to appeal for her safe return. Some expatriates even offered a reward for information about her whereabouts.
Following the recovery of the body, Awal said that three suspects had been detained. They are Muntaha’s neighbour Marjia Akter, Marjia's mother Alifjan, and her grandmother Kutubjan.
“It appears Muntaha was abducted on Nov 3. Marjia and her mother Alifjan allegedly strangled her the same day and buried her body in the muddy bank of a canal near their house,” said Awal.
In the wee hours of Sunday, locals saw Alifjan trying to move the body from the canal. She was reportedly attempting to take it to a nearby pond to hide evidence of the crime.
Locals immediately alerted the police, who then recovered the body.
“Marjia was initially detained around midnight over the suspected link to the disappearance. She was brought in for questioning, but she provided no information and even smiled while responding casually.”
“After we found the body, she was formally taken into custody.”
Alifjan, known locally as an alms seeker, is still under investigation. The motive behind Muntaha’s murder remains unclear, according to the police.
After the body was found, angry locals set fire to Marjia’s home.
“On the day of the incident, Muntaha was playing at my house. We were hopeful she would be found alive. We never imagined she would be killed and her body found so close by,” local resident Abdul Wahid said.
He called for the harshest punishment for those responsible for the crime.",https://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/65760867b49d,"10 Nov 2024, 01:04 PM",Bangladesh
